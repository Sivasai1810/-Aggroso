# AI_NOTES.md
## How AI Was Used
Specifically, AI was used for:
- Refining prompt templates for each workflow step
- For clean UI
- Clarifying Groq Model api usage
- Improving readability and structure of documentation

## What Was Checked and Implemented Manually
The following were implemented and verified manually:
- Step handler mapping and execution order
- Groq Model API request and response handling
- Error handling and validations
- README and documentation cleanup

All code was reviewed, tested, and adjusted manually to ensure correctness.
## LLM and Provider Used

LLM:openai/gpt-oss-120b
Provider:Groq
## Why This LLM and Provider Were Chosen
- Groq provides fast inference, which is suitable for workflow-based automation
- Easy API integration with a clean SDK
- Works well for non-streaming, step-by-step backend workflows
## Summary

AI was used as a supporting tool for thinking, structuring, and refinement.  
Core logic, design decisions, and implementation were human-driven and manually verified.
